CLAS12 TARGETS README

--------------------------------------------------

There are two variations of the LH2 target.
"original", that has a simple model of the cell and scattering chambers
"elaborate", that produces a target according to drawings


In MYSQL mode, before building the geometry one must
upload the parameters onto the DB.

The commands to build the geometry, banks, hit defs
and materials are:

upload_parameters.pl config.dat   < only for MYSQL factory

./targets.pl config.dat




# Experiments:


## RGF: Sept 22 2022

Author: Yu-Chun Hung

Experiment Description: Measure the structure function F2 of the neutron by tagging the spectator proton in the RTPC detector. Deuterium, hydrogen, and helium gas are used at 5.6 atm pressure.

### Variations: bonusD2, bounsH2, bonusHe

### Files used: 

### How to use it in the gcard
1. Set up the target with bonusD2 variations:
<detector name="experiments/clas12/targets/target" factory="TEXT" variation="bonusD2"/>
2. Shift the target position by 30 mm
<detector name="target">    <position x="0*cm"  y="0*cm"  z="-3.00*cm"  />  </detector>
