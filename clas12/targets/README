CLAS12 TARGETS README

--------------------------------------------------

There are two variations of the LH2 target.
"original", that has a simple model of the cell and scattering chambers
"elaborate", that produces a target according to drawings


In MYSQL mode, before building the geometry one must
upload the parameters onto the DB.

The commands to build the geometry, banks, hit defs
and materials are:

upload_parameters.pl config.dat   < only for MYSQL factory

./targets.pl config.dat
