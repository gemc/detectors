Engineering center is 1.27327 m downstream
And rotated 180 degrees about the y axis

--------------------------------------------------

The geometry consists of a barrel of 50 scintillators.

In MYSQL mode, before building the geometry one must
upload the parameters onto the DB.

The commands to build the geometry, banks, hit defs
and materials are:

upload_parameters.pl config.dat   < only for MYSQL factory

./cnd.pl config.dat

Light guides downstream: 1330 faces each
Light guides upstream: 636 faces each
Scintillator: 132 faces each

Total number of faces: 1330*48 + 636*48 + 132*48
							= 63,840  + 30,528 + 6,336  = 100,000 faces

Benchmark:

- 10K events with g4volumes 11.5s
- 10K events with cad volumes: 13.1s  (13% slow down)

With solenoid:

- 10K events with g4volumes 17.3.5s
- 10K events with cad volumes: 18.1s  (4% slow down)
